My solution to the FrontendMentor.io Intro component with sign-up form challenge.

Demo: https://zoldykk.github.io/signup-landing-page/

## Challenge
    
<p>Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.<p/>

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

     * Receive an error message when the form is submitted if any
     * See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
     * Receive an error message when the form is submitted if any
        * input field is empty
        * the email address is not formatted correctly
