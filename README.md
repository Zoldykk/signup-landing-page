My solution to the FrontendMentor.io Intro component with sign-up form challenge.

Demo: https://zoldykk.github.io/signup-landing-page/

## Challenge
    
<p>Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.<p/>

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
      <li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
         <li>Receive an error message when the form is submitted if any input field is empty and the email address is not formatted correctly</li>
    </ul>
